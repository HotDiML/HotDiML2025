The workshop provides a platform to share results, valuable critiques, and broad discussion papers. Therefore, HotDiML invites researchers and practitioners to submit four different types of papers, namely:

position papers offering a constructive critique of state-of-the-art DiML approaches or their implementation in real-world scenarios
experimental evaluation papers, presenting preliminary (un)successful or unexpected results on novel ideas
research papers providing thorough insights on challenges and open questions regarding the design and adoption of DiML systems
report papers presenting valuable lessons learned while proposing and/or testing promising but unproven ideas.

The papers submitted at HotDiML should have the potential to open a new line of research for the community, where the authors can benefit from community feedback.">
